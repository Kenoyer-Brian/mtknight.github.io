          <h2>Target Audience</h2>
          <p>Outdoor enthusiasts, their families, and the local businesses that cater to them. Given the outdoor nature of the
            audience, most will access the site through their phones while businesses will use a desktop browser.</p>

          <h2>Personas</h2>
          <p> Meet Rick. He's a college student who likes to spend his weekends off campus and in the wild. He's single with no kids
              and spends his freetime with friends hiking around south-east Idaho. He spends his freetime this way because it helps 
              him unwind after a rigourous school week and reconnect with nature after being indoors all week. 
          </p>
          <p> Meet Adele. She's a married mother of four trying to find ways to get her family together and out of the house for some
              fresh air and exercise. On clear days she likes to take her kids out for a picnic with her husband so everyone can run 
              around, explore, and spend some quality time together.

          <h2>Scenarios</h2>
          <p>How warm is it today? Can I wear a teeshirt?</p>
          <p>Will it be clear enough today for a picnic?</p>
          <p>What's the visibility going to be like? Good enough for a long walk and some pictures?</p>
          <p>Which route should we take today?<p>
          <p>Is it safe to do a little backpacking in today's weather?</p>
